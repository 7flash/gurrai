### Setup üõ†Ô∏è

Setting up GurrAI is straightforward and essential for a smooth experience. Follow these steps to get up and running:

#### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can check your Python version with:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

2. **Helix Editor**: Install the Helix editor. Follow the installation instructions on the [Helix GitHub page](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix).

3. **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain an API key from OpenAI. You can sign up and get your API key [here](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

#### Installation

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/7flash/gurrai.git ~/Documents/gurrai
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/Documents/gurrai
    ```

3. **Install required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:**
    ```bash
    echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'" >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

5. **Add an alias in your `.zshrc` file to expedite the invocation of GurrAI:**
    ```bash
    echo "alias ai='python3 ~/Documents/gurrai/src/ai.py'" >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

Adding this alias ensures that you can quickly start prompting by simply typing `ai` in your terminal. This step is a crucial part of the setup.

### Usage üìö

### Write prompt directly

```bash
ai
```

It will spawn a helix editor inside of your terminal session, where you can write your prompt, and :wq to execute the prompt, you will see response appended to your prompt with |assistant| role, that you can continue the conversation by editing or adding new messages.

#### Input file as argument

To kickstart your conversation with AI, simply run `ai` in the terminal:

```bash
ai path/to/your/prompt-in.txt
```

- **Step 1:** Type your prompt in the Helix editor.
- **Step 2:** See the response in the Helix editor spawned along with your prompt.
- **Step 3:** Iteratively continue your conversation.

This workflow allows you to refine and build upon your prompts iteratively, making your AI interactions more productive and fluid.

#### Piping prompt file

GurrAI supports Unix-like interactions, allowing you to spawn a new conversation by piping a prompt file:

```bash
cat prompts/example.txt | ai
```

This command reads the content of `example.txt` and uses it as the prompt for the AI. It's a true Unix way of interacting with AI!

#### Referencing Files and Sections üìÅ

You can reference any local files directly within your prompt:

```markdown
file:./path/to/yourfile.txt
```

For more granular control, you can reference specific sections of files using hashtags after the file name:

```python
file:./path/to/yourfile.py#section
```

In Python files, GurrAI will look for comments such as `# .section` to locate the referenced section. For other file types, the corresponding comment style (e.g., `// .section` for JavaScript) will be used.

#### Referencing Local and Global Paths üåê

You can reference local paths relative to the `prompts` folder, as well as global paths starting with `/`:

```markdown
file:./relative/path/to/file.txt
file:/absolute/path/to/file.txt
```

This flexibility ensures you can easily include any necessary files or sections in your prompts.

#### Roles and Ignoring Messages üé≠

GurrAI supports defining different message roles within your prompt file using the `|role|` separator between messages. For example:

```markdown
|user|
What is the weather today?
|assistant|
The weather is sunny with a high of 25¬∞C.
```

You can also exclude messages by adding `!ignore` after the `|role|`:

```markdown
|user|
What is the weather today?
|assistant|!ignore
The weather is sunny with a high of 25¬∞C.
```

This feature allows you to control which messages are processed and which are not, enhancing the flexibility of your interactions.

### Important Dependency üçÉ

GurrAI relies on the Helix editor, which provides a powerful, efficient, and intuitive way to interact with your prompts and AI responses. The Helix editor's `vim`-like style makes it the best editor for this purpose.
